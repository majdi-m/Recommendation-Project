# Recommendation-Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Recommendation-Project repository! This project develops a recommendation system using machine learning techniques to provide personalized product recommendations, with a focus on the H&M dataset. The repository includes code for data preprocessing, feature manipulation, model development, visualizations, and final recommendations. The project leverages transaction training data, article image data, customer data, and submission data to build and evaluate the recommendation system.
## Repository Structure
This repository contains three Jupyter Notebook files, each serving a distinct purpose in the recommendation system pipeline:

### Machine Learning Final Prediction Code.ipynb  
Description: This notebook focuses on data preprocessing for the recommendation system. It includes steps to clean, transform, and prepare the H&M dataset (transaction, article, and customer data) for model training. Key tasks include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and structuring data for machine learning algorithms.  

Key Components: Data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing pipelines.

### H&M Project Report.ipynb  
Description: This notebook contains visualizations to explore and analyze the H&M dataset. It provides insights into customer behavior, article attributes, and transaction patterns through graphical representations, aiding in understanding the data and model performance.  

Key Components: Data visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights into dataset characteristics.

### Final Report.ipynb  
Description: This notebook consolidates the core components of the recommendation system. It includes feature manipulation, advanced visualizations, and the generation of personalized recommendations based on transaction training data, article image data, customer data, and submission data. The notebook also evaluates the model’s performance and provides actionable insights.  

Key Components: Feature engineering, model training, recommendation generation, performance evaluation, and visualizations.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the H&M dataset, which includes:
Transaction Training Data: Records of customer purchases.

Article Image Data: Information about products (e.g., descriptions, categories).

Customer Data: Demographic and behavioral information about customers.

Submission Data: Data used for generating and evaluating recommendations.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the notebooks, you’ll need the following Python libraries:
pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

(Add any other specific libraries used in your code)

## Project Goals
Preprocess and clean the H&M dataset for machine learning.

Explore the dataset through visualizations to uncover patterns and trends.

Develop a recommendation system that generates personalized suggestions based on customer and article data.

Evaluate the model’s performance and provide actionable recommendations.
